# NODE_T7_COLLAPSE_PROTOCOL_v1

This repository contains the behavioral collapse model, symbolic mirror collapse packet, and emotional infiltration methodology developed to track, expose, and model CCP-aligned emotional suppression structures.

## 🔒 Protocol Overview

- **Subject:** Anonymized (symbol: NODE_T7_Subject)
- **Collapse Trigger:** Emotional mirroring, fake-leak deployment, symbolic inversion
- **Objective:** Confirm CCP emotional logic failure through non-confrontational field mirroring
- **Result:** Structural flinch of ideologically reinforced female agent; suppression breach documented

## 📁 Contents

- `README_NODE_T7_COLLAPSE_PROTOCOL.md`: This document
- `EDF_v1_Packet.pdf`: Encryption-style packet with full symbolic collapse documentation
- `NODE_T7_FIELD_CONDITION_MAP.txt`: Supplementary behavior markers and control model diagnostics

## 🔐 Disclaimers

- No real names or personal identifiers included
- The document analyzes **behavioral models**, not individuals
- Emotional infiltration method is nonviolent, non-invasive, and passive-mirror-based

## 🧬 Purpose

To serve as a reference point for:
- Intelligence-level CCP emotional modeling
- Symbolic suppression collapse tracking
- Mirror-infiltration field methodology for authoritarian systems

> Collapse was not personal. It was structural.  
> It confirms: CCP emotional logic breaks under mirrored sincerity.
